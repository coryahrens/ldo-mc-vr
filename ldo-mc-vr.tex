\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Radiation shielding is an important and interesting problem from various
perspectives. Simulation of shielding scenarios is critical for health physics
and nuclear security applications, but arriving at a solution for a given
response of interest (e.g., neutron flux at a given location) can be
computationally difficult in the context of
the magnitude of particle attenuation often seen in shielding problems.

The steady-state Boltzmann transport equation is typically solved using either 
deterministic methods or stochastic (Monte Carlo) methods. So-called ``hybrid''
methods aim to combine the favorable aspects of deterministic and Monte Carlo
methods to achieve better results. The CADIS (consistent adjoint driven
importance sampling) and \fwc\ (forward-weighted CADIS) methods are the current
state of the art in Monte Carlo variance reduction parameter generation.
Although hybrid methods are used to
significant effect in radiation shielding problems, they do not entirely
mitigate the negative aspects of the combined simulation types.

One particular area of study where hybrid methods tend to fall short is in
shielding problems with highly anisotropic particle movement and particle
streaming pathways. This is because the standard implementation of the CADIS
and \fwc\ methods is based on scalar particle flux rather than angular particle
flux. So, solutions from deterministic calculations exclude information about
how particles move toward a response of interest. For problems with strong
anisotropies in the particle flux, the importance map and biased source 
developed using the standard space/energy treatment may not represent the real
importance well enough to sufficiently improve efficiency in the Monte Carlo
calculation. 

This work aims to gauge the performance of Monte Carlo biasing parameters based
on scalar flux solutions from solving the Lagrange Discrete Ordinates (LDO)
equations. We will be employing the LDO equations' solutions in the standard
CADIS and \fwc\ methods to assess how well the LDO representation's unique
treatment of scattering and asymmetry in angle incorporate angular information
into the resultant scalar flux solutions and corresponding Monte Carlo biasing
parameters.

%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

Here we begin by describing the CADIS (consistent adjoint driven importance 
sampling) and \fwc\ (forward-weighted consistent adjoint driven importance
sampling) methods, which are the current state
of the art of Monte Carlo variance reduction parameter generation. These are 
introduced first because this work 
employs solutions of the LDO equations in combination with the CADIS and \fwc\ 
methods via the ADVANTG software.

%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
\subsection{CADIS and \fwc}

%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
\subsubsection{CADIS}

The CADIS method was introduced by Wagner and Haghighat to automate Monte Carlo
variance reduction parameter generation \cite{cadis}. CADIS is based on the
source biasing and weight window techniques , does not depend heavily 
on user experience, and was implemented as described in Reference \cite{cadis}
in the MCNP \cite{mcnp} code. Most importantly, the result of using the CADIS
method is source biasing parameters and weight window target
values such that particles are born with the target weights.

The goal of most Monte Carlo transport problems is to calculate some response
(scalar flux, dose, etc.) at some location in phase-space. This can be posed as
solving the following integral equation:

\begin{equation}
R = \int_P \psi(P)\sigma_d(P)dP,
\label{eq:cadis_r1}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $R$ is the response of interest, $\psi$ is the neutron angular
flux, and $\sigma_d$ is some objective function in the phase-space
$(\vecr, E, \bo) \in P$. With the mathematical adjoint identity, it can be
shown that

\begin{equation}
R = \int_P \psi^{\dagger}(P)q(P)dP,
\label{eq:cadis_r2}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\psi^{\dagger}$ and $q$ are the adjoint neutron angular flux
function and the particle source density, respectively. For a given problem
with a vacuum boundary condition, Equations \ref{eq:cadis_r1} and
\ref{eq:cadis_r2} are equivalent expressions for $R$. The adjoint neutron
angular flux function $\psi^{\dagger}$ has physical meaning as the expected
contribution to the response $R$ from a particle in phase-space $P$. In other
words, the adjoint flux function is significant because it represents the
importance of those source particles to the response of interest.

To calculate the response with the Monte Carlo method, the independent
variables are sampled from the probability density function (PDF) $q(P)$.
However, this may not be the best PDF from which to sample, so an alternative
PDF $\qhat(P)$ can be introduced into the integral:

\begin{equation}
R = \int_P \left[\frac{\psi^{\dagger}(P)q(P)}{\qhat(P)}\right]\qhat(P)dP,
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\qhat(P) \geq 0$ and the integral of $\qhat(P)$ over $P$ is 
normalized to unity. Then, the alternative PDF $\qhat(P)$ that will minimize
the variance of the response is given by

\begin{equation}
\qhat(P) = \frac{\psi^{\dagger}(P)q(P)}{\int_P\psi^{\dagger}(P)q(P)dP}.
\label{eq:qhat}
\end{equation}

Because the source variables are sampled from this new biased PDF, the
statistical weight of the source particles must be corrected such that

\begin{equation}
w(P)\qhat(P) = w_0q(P),
\label{eq:cadis_w1}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $w_0$ is the unbiased particle starting weight and is set equal
to 1. Substituting Equation \ref{eq:qhat} into Equation \ref{eq:cadis_w1} and
solving for $w(P)$ gives the following expression for the statistical weight of
the particles:

\begin{equation}
w(P) = \frac{\int_P\psi^{\dagger}(P)q(P)dP}{\psi^{\dagger}(P)}
= \frac{R}{\psi^{\dagger}(P)}.
\label{eq:cadis_w2}
\end{equation}

\noindent Equation \ref{eq:cadis_w2} demonstrates an inverse relationship
between this adjoint (importance) function and the statistical particle weight.
With this, reduced variance can be achieved when all source and transport
sampling is proportional to its importance. The source particles' energy and
position are sampled from the biased source distribution

\begin{equation}
\qhat(\vecr,E) = 
\frac{\phi^{\dagger}(\vecr,E)q(\vecr,E)}
{\int_V\int_E\phi^{\dagger}(\vecr,E)q(\vecr,E) dE\ d\vecr} 
= \frac{\phi^{\dagger}(\vecr,E)q(\vecr,E)}{R}.
\label{eq:cadis_sb}
\end{equation}

To bias particles undergoing the transport process, the weight window technique
is applied. Weight window lower bounds $w_{\ell}$ must be calculated such that
the statistical weights defined in Equation \ref{eq:cadis_w2} fall at the
center of the weight window intervals. The width of a given interval is denoted
by $c_u = w_u/w_{\ell}$, the ratio of upper and lower weight window values. The
weight window lower bounds are then given by

\begin{equation}
w_{\ell}(\vecr,E) = \frac{w}{\left(\frac{c_u +1}{2}\right)} 
= \frac{R}{\phi^{\dagger}(\vecr,E)}\frac{1}{\left(\frac{c_u +1}{2}\right)}.
\label{eq:cadis_tb}
\end{equation}

The key result of the foregoing discussion is that the statistical weights of
the source particles are within the bounds of the weight windows. In other
words, the source-biasing parameters and the weight window target values are
consistent. This circumvents the potential of particles being immediately split
or rouletted upon birth and avoids the resultant degradation in computational
efficiency. We refer the reader to \cite{cadis} for a complete discussion of
results and analysis of the initial implementation of the CADIS method. The
CADIS method is very effective for automated optimization of localized
detectors but falls short of efficiently optimizing distributed responses.
\fwc, discussed in the next section, was developed to address this issue.

%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
\subsubsection{\fwc}

\fwc, is a variation on the CADIS method to increase the efficiency of Monte
Carlo calculations of distributions and responses at multiple localized
detectors \cite{fwcadis}.

For this global variance reduction method, a response with uniformly-low
statistical uncertainty across all phase-space is desired. One way to target
this for a given Monte Carlo simulation is to uniformly distribute the
particles throughout the system. Though this is not a physical response, it is
a proxy for the goal of obtaining uniform uncertainty. It also indicates the
possibility of developing an adjoint importance function that represents the
importance of particles to achieving the goal of uniform particle distribution.

With this new problem formulation, the problem of calculating particle density
is cast into the response formulation:

\begin{equation}
R = \int_{4\pi}\int_{V}\int_{E}\psi(\vecr,E,\bo)f(\vecr,E,\bo)dE\ dV\ d\bo,
\end{equation}

\noindent where $f(\vecr,E,\bo)$ is some function that converts angular
particle flux to Monte Carlo particle density. The Monte Carlo particle 
density can be estimated by

\begin{equation}
m(\vecr,E,\bo) = \frac{n(\vecr,E,\bo)}{\bar{w}(\vecr,E,\bo)} 
= \frac{\psi(\vecr,E,\bo)}{\bar{w}(\vecr,E,\bo)v(\vecr,E,\bo)}
\end{equation}

\noindent and the total Monte Carlo density can be estimated by

\begin{equation}
R = \int_{4\pi}\int_{V}\int_{E}\psi(\vecr,E,\bo)
\left[\frac{1}{\bar{w}(\vecr,E,\bo)v(\vecr,E,\bo)}\right]dV\ dE\ d\bo.
\label{eq:fwcadis_r}
\end{equation}

If the average particle weight is set proportional to the physical particle
density, then the Monte Carlo particle density should be approximately uniform
in phase-space:

\begin{equation}
R = \int_{4\pi}\int_{V}\int_{E}\psi(\vecr,E,\bo)
\left[\frac{1}{\psi(\vecr,E,\bo)}\right]dV\ dE\ d\bo.
\end{equation}

\noindent By then defining the adjoint source as the bracketed term in the
above equation,

\begin{equation}
q^{\dagger}(\vecr,E,\bo) = \frac{1}{\psi(\vecr,E,\bo)},
\end{equation}

\noindent we can calculate an adjoint importance function that represents the
importance of particles to achieving the desired objective of uniformly
distributed Monte Carlo particles. This should, in turn, correspond to
approximately uniform statistical uncertainties. The method physically 
orresponds to weighting the adjoint source with the inverse of the forward
flux; the adjoint source will be high where the forward flux is low and the
adjoint source will be low where the forward flux is high. With this method,
after the adjoint has been determined, the standard CADIS procedures are used
to calculate consistent source biasing parameters and weight windows.

\section{Test Cases and Run Parameters}

In this section we introduce and describe the test case scenarios examined as
well as the various parameters chosen for the calculations in this work. 

%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
\subsection{Steel Plate Embedded in Water}
\label{sec:steel_params}

The first test case we describe is an idealized geometry of a steel plate 
embedded in water; it is modeled after the scenario presented in Reference 
\cite{wilsonslaybaugh}. 
A diagram of the problem geometry is shown in Figure \ref{steelxz} and a list
of material properties used in the problem is given in Table \ref{steel-mat}.
In Figure \ref{steelxz}, the orange region contains the source material, the 
black region is composed of steel, the blue regions indicate water, and the 
white region is composed of air.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{img/steel-xz.png}
\caption{Steel plate in water geometry ($x-z$ slice through $y = 25$ cm) 
         \cite{wilsonslaybaugh}.}
\label{steelxz}
\end{figure}

The problem measurements are $53\times50\times140$ cm. The scenario is uniform 
in the $y$-direction and materials vary mainly in the $z$-direction. The source
region extends from 0 to 15 cm, the steel shield extends between 15 and 30 cm, 
the water and steel plate extend from 30 to 130 cm, and the air extends from 
130 to 140 cm. The steel plate is 3 cm wide and is centered at $x = 26.5$ cm. 
Vacuum boundary conditions were used at the problem boundaries.

A non-uniform Cartesian mesh was used for the spatial discretization in the 
deterministic calculations. In the $x$-direction, voxel width is 5 cm between
$x = 0$ cm and $x = 25$ cm, 0.5 cm between $x = 25$ cm and $x = 28$ cm, and 5 
cm between $x = 28$ cm and $x = 53$ cm. A uniform spacing of voxel width 1 cm 
was used in the $y$-direction. In the $z$-direction, the spatial cell width is
3 cm between $z = 0$ cm and $z = 30$ cm and 2 cm between $z = 30$ cm and 
$z = 140$ cm.

\begin{table}[!htb]

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The composition of the neutron source block is a homogenization of water,
zirconium, and uranium and was calculated based on the geometry and composition
of the Rowlands UO$_2$ pin cell benchmark specification \cite{pincell}. The
source is a U-235 fission 
spectrum that is uniformly distributed throughout the homogenized material. The
compositions of air, carbon steel, and water were taken from the Compendium of 
Material Composition Data for Radiation Transport Modeling \cite{pnnl}.

%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
\subsection{Dog-Legged Void Neutron (DLVN)}

The next problem modeled is the dog-legged void neutron (DLVN) experimental 
benchmark, which was designed to measure neutron streaming in iron with air
voids. The model used in the following calculations was constructed from
References \cite{sw-dlvn,j-dlvn,dlvn1991}. The two materials used in the
problem are elemental iron and polyethylene. The polyethylene composition used
was C$_2$H$_4$. This is listed as ``polyethylene, non-borated'' and is material
248 in Reference \cite{pnnl}. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{img/dlvn.png}
\caption{Centerline cutaway of DLVN setup \cite{sw-dlvn}.}
\label{dlvn}
\end{figure}

The problem measurements are $40\times54\times48$ inches. A uniform spatial
mesh was imposed over the entire problem, with voxels measuring 1 inch per
side. The neutron source in this problem is a Cf-252 point source located at
the center of the $x-$ and $y-$directions and at $z = 9$ inches. This point
source was approximated as a small volumetric source in the tests in this
work.

The experimental configuration is symmetric about the $y-z$ plane at $x = 0$
and so is usually simulated with a reflecting boundary at $x = 0$ and vacuum
boundaries on all other sides of the configuration. For the tests in this work,
the use of reflecting boundary conditions was not available, so the model used 
was constructed to represent the entire experimental geometry configuration.
Vacuum boundary conditions were applied to the outside of the entire problem.

%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
\subsection{Simplified Portal Monitor}

The final problem described here is a simplified portal monitor scenario.
Portal monitors are large detector panels used to screen cargo for illicit
radioactive materials. The problem models a cargo container holding a Ba-133
photon point source and large blocks of homogenized iron and polyethylene. 
The geometry and material configuration used in this test is the same as the
example problem listed in Section 7.2 of the ADVANTG technical report
\cite{advantg}. Diagrams of the simplified portal monitor problem are shown in
Figure \ref{p1}.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\centering
\begin{subfigure}{0.475\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/portal1.png}
\end{subfigure}
\begin{subfigure}{0.475\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/portal2.png}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{Top and side views of simplified portal problem \cite{advantg}.}
\label{p1}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{p1}, the different colors represent different materials. The NaI
detectors are red and the gray material is concrete. The two types of material
blocks are iron, shown in green, and polyethylene, shown in white. The steel
cargo container surrounds the particle source and material blocks and is a
semitransparent blue.

A non-uniform Cartesian mesh that captures all of the problem's material
boundaries was constructed for this simulation. The voxels are nominally 10 cm
thick within the cargo container. Additional mesh planes parallel to the
$x-$axis were added to the gaps between the homogenized iron and polyethylene
blocks \cite{advantg}. Vacuum boundary conditions are present at all problem
edges.

\subsection{Calculation Parameters}
\label{params}

All of the deterministic calculations used 32 processes on a 2.8GHz AMD 
Opteron\texttrademark\ 6320 Processor \cite{amd}, two for each logical CPU
unit. With this in mind, all deterministic calculations were set to use the
same Denovo computational block structure of 8 blocks in the $x-$dimension, 4
blocks in the $y-$dimension, and 1 block in the $z-$dimension;
thus the total number of computational blocks equals the number of processes.
Denovo uses the Koch-Baker-Alcouffe (KBA) parallel sweep algorithm for high
parallel efficiency in calculating transport sweeps \cite{denovo}; the
aforementioned block structure was chosen to achieve the same parallel
performance among all test case deterministic simulations. 

All but one of the test cases use the same coarse energy group structure
specified in the ``27n19g'' library; the groups in this library are listed in
Table A-1 of Appendix A of the ADVANTG technical report \cite{advantg}. The
exception to this is the simplified portal problem. The highest energy
emission line of Ba-133 is 383.8 keV, so weight window bounds above this
energy would not be used in the Monte Carlo simulation. Thus, the highest
energy group of the deterministic calculations was set to group number 41,
which has an upper energy of 400 keV \cite{advantg}. Because 
energy discretization is treated the same way between the traditional discrete 
ordinates formulation and the LDO equations, it was assumed that energy group 
structure would not greatly impact the comparative results.

In the deterministic calculations, forward solutions for the test cases were
generated using quadruple range (QR), Galerkin, linear-discontinuous finite 
element (LDFE), and LDO quadrature sets. All test cases were run with the same 
quadrature sets; increasing sizes of quadrature sets were used to ascertain the
angular mesh refinement necessary for a given quadrature type to converge to a 
solution. 

QR quadrature sets were chosen to generate the reference results against which
the  LDO results are compared. QR was selected because they are commonly used 
in hybrid methods for Monte Carlo variance reduction parameter generation and 
therefore provide a relevant baseline. The Exnihilo framework allows the user
to select the number of polar and azimuthal angles in each octant when using a
QR quadrature set; for these studies, the number of polar and azimuthal angles
per octant were each set to the same value, with the values ranging from one
per octant (for a total of eight angles) to nine per octant (for a total of
648 angles). 

LDFE and Galerkin quadrature sets were also chosen because of their interesting
mathematical properties. Compared to QR quadrature sets, LDFE quadrature sets
have been shown to exhibit more accurate solutions for the scalar flux in both 
simple and more complex geometry and material configurations \cite{ldfe}; they 
approximate the angular flux using direction cosines and are determined by
requiring that the integration of the related interpolation basis functions is
equal to the surface area of a unit sphere. For LDFE quadrature sets, if $N$ is
the order of the quadrature, there are $4^{(N+1)}$ angles per octant
\cite{exum}. In this work, the LDFE quadrature orders used were one (128 total
angles) and two (8192 total angles).

Galerkin quadrature sets offer several advantages relative to the standard \sn\
method for problems with highly anisotropic scattering \cite{morel}. Similar to
the LDO equations, the ``hybrid collocation-Galerkin-S$_\mathrm{N}$'' method
developed by Morel has the same algebraic structure as the traditional discrete
ordinates equations but employs a nonstandard scattering treatment.
For reasons noted below, the Galerkin quadrature orders used were 2 and 4. For
an \sn\ order $N$, a given Galerkin quadrature set (as implemented in Exnihilo)
has a total of $N(N+2)$ angles; the Galerkin quadrature sets
used in this work have 8 and 24 total angles, respectively.

The degrees and sizes of the LDO quadrature sets used are listed in Table
\ref{ldo-n}.

The step characteristics (SC) spatial discretization was used in all of the
deterministic calculations based on the recommendation listed in Section 9.1.3
of the Exnihilo user manual \cite{exum}. In the DLVN and portal monitor
scenarios, the point sources are approximated as small spherical volumetric
sources. Except for the Galerkin quadratures, all runs used a P$_5$ scattering
expansion. At the time of this writing, Galerkin quadrature sets are
implemented in the Exnihilo framework with the restriction that the \pn\ order
be one greater than the \sn\ order. That is, for the Galerkin quadrature set of
\sn\ order 2, the corresponding \pn\ order is set equal to 3, and for the
Galerkin quadrature set of \sn\ order 4, the \pn\ order is 5.

The Monte Carlo calculations in this work were run on one Dell PowerEdge C6220
server blade node with two Intel Xeon 10-core Ivy Bridge processors (a total of
20 cores) \cite{savio}. All jobs were specified to use 21 MPI tasks; MCNP
reserves one ``master'' process for communication and transports particles with
the remaining available tasks \cite{mcnp}. So, for the purpose of parallel
efficiency, one transport process per hardware core was used here.

All of the Monte Carlo calculations were run with a fixed number of particle 
histories to simulate. For the steel plate in water and simplified portal 
monitor cases, all calculations used 1\E{9} particle histories in both the
CADIS and \fwc\ contexts. The DLVN experimental benchmark case was simulated 
with 1\E{10} neutron histories as it was modeled after calculations in
Reference \cite{sw-dlvn}. All Monte Carlo tally results are reported with the
one standard deviation confidence interval $\xbar(1\pm R)$ where the relative
error $R \equiv S_{\xbar}/\xbar$ \cite{mcnp}.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
\subsection{Steel Plate Embedded in Water}

%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
\subsubsection{CADIS}

For the CADIS calculations for the steel plate embedded in water, the adjoint
source was set to be the detector tally.

%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
\subsubsection{\fwc}

For the \fwc\ calculations for the steel plate in water, the adjoint source was
set to be a mesh tally over all of the air beyond the steel plate. The
discretization for the adjoint source mesh tally is the same as that listed in 
Section \ref{sec:steel_params}. Specifically, the adjoint source mesh is
identical to the overall problem mesh in the $x-$ and $y-$directions but starts
at $z = 130$ cm and extends to the problem boundary at $z = 140$ cm.

%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
\subsection{Dog-Legged Void Neutron (DLVN)}

%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
\subsubsection{CADIS}

To study the DLVN problem in the context of the CADIS method, the adjoint
source was set to be the tally located at detector \#14 in the original
experiment.

%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
\subsubsection{\fwc}

Considering the DLVN case with the \fwc\ method, the adjoint source was
specified to be the combination of all of the detector locations in the
problem.

Figures \ref{dlvn-fwc-5} and \ref{dlvn-fwc-9} exhibit the same lack of trend in
flux tally as a function of angular mesh refinement. That is, in general, for
detector locations \#5 and \#9, using more discrete angles in the \fwc\
deterministic calculations does not greatly impact the flux tally result from
MCNP. Figures \ref{dlvn-fwc-13} and \ref{dlvn-fwc-14} show similar behavior
with the exception of the most coarse angular meshes. For these detector
locations, any angular mesh refinement other than the coarsest angular mesh
will produce a consistent forward  scalar flux tally result. Figures
\ref{dlvn-fwc-11} and \ref{dlvn-fwc-12} show slightly more variation in flux
tally result with angular mesh refinement. These two detector locations'
tallies have also higher statistical error relative to those at the other
detector locations.  Overall, though, the flux tallies at detectors \#11 and
\#12 are not heavily impacted by the refinement of the angular mesh used in
generating the Monte Carlo biasing parameters, but a mid-range number of
quadrature points should be used to avoid the large statistical errors seen at
the extreme ends of the angular mesh refinement spectrum.

Like their corresponding flux tally graphs, Figures \ref{dlvn-fwc-5},
\ref{dlvn-fwc-9}, and \ref{dlvn-fwc-13} show almost no variation in FOM with
angular mesh refinement for the tallies at detector locations \#5, \#9, and
\#13. This is to be expected, considering the uniform statistical error and
stable flux tally results at these locations. Figure \ref{dlvn-fwc-11} shows
variation in FOM with angular mesh refinement that is more varied, which
corresponds to the larger statistical uncertainties in the flux tally values
for detector \#11. Figure \ref{dlvn-fwc-12} shows little variation in FOM with
angular mesh refinement with the exception of the finest QR set. Lastly,
\ref{dlvn-fwc-14} shows an upper FOM limit of approximately 200 across all
quadrature types, with the Figure of Merit largely consistent across
quadrature types with the exception of QR angular meshes.

In Table \ref{dlvn-fwc-det} we compare the Monte Carlo forward flux tally
results for the  representative quadrature sets listed in Section \ref{params}.
Results from the unbiased Monte  Carlo calculation are also included for
comparison. All Monte Carlo flux tally values are reported with an uncertainty
of one standard deviation. For all detector locations, the Monte Carlo flux
tallies do not match the experimentally measured flux values for any of the
representative quadrature sets or the unbiased calculation, so we only compare
the Monte Carlo calculations in this table. We do note that the Monte Carlo
calculations overestimate the flux tally at all detector locations with the
exception of detector \#13. The flux tallies at detectors 5, 9, 13, and 14 all
match within statistical uncertainty for all of the Monte Carlo calculations.
At detector \#11, the biased Monte Carlo calculations match within standard
error, but the calculations using the QR and LDO biasing parameter fall outside
of the error bounds of the unbiased calculation. Somewhat similarly, at
detector \#14, all of the biased calculations match one another within
statistical uncertainty, but they are all outside of the error bounds of the
unbiased flux tally calculation.

To examine the FOM values in a more quantifiable way, Table 
\ref{dlvn-fwc-fom-table} lists the FOM values for all detector locations for
each of the representative quadrature sets as well as the unbiased calculation.
The maximum FOM value in each detector location column is emphasized. Of the
six detector locations, the representative LDO quadrature set achieves the
highest FOM for two of the locations. The representative QR quadrature set is
the only other type to also deliver the highest Figure of Merit for two out of
six detectors; the Galerkin and LDFE quadrature set biasing parameters each
only achieve the highest FOM for one detector location. So, the representative
LDO quadrature set's biasing parameters perform comparably to those from the
representative QR quadrature set with respect to obtaining high FOM values for
multiple detector locations using the \fwc\ method for the DLVN problem.

In summary, for test case scenarios such as the DLVN problem in which the
\fwc\ method is used to generate Monte Carlo variance reduction parameters to
optimize the response at multiple flux tally detector locations, a relatively
coarse quadrature set of any of the types studied here can be used to
sufficient effect. However, the coarsest available quadrature sets should be
avoided; flux tally results and Figures of Merit for the various detector
locations tend to level out as a function of angular mesh refinement beyond
the quadrature sets with the fewest number of angles. In particular, if using
an LDO quadrature set in another similar scenario, we would suggest using a
point set of order 5 or 8.

\subsection{Simplified Portal Monitor}

%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
\subsubsection{CADIS}

To study calculations for the simplified portal monitor scenario in the context
of the CADIS method, the adjoint source was set to be the top detector in the
small array.

%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
\subsubsection{\fwc}

To generate Monte Carlo variance reduction parameters for the simplified portal
monitor using the \fwc\ method, the adjoint source was set to be all four
detector locations in the problem's detector array.

Figure \ref{cargo-fwc} shows MCNP-reported forward scalar flux tallies and
Figures of Merit for all four detectors in the array. The flux tallies and FOM
values are each plotted as a function of the number of discrete angles used in
the quadrature sets that were used to generate biasing parameters. In all
plots, the unbiased calculation result is shown as a horizontal black line. At
all detector locations, the forward flux tallies and FOM values show the same
trend of leveling off to a stable value once the angular mesh used for the
\fwc\ biasing parameters has been refined past the few coarsest numbers of
discrete angles. At all detector locations except for the \nth{2} in the array,
the unbiased calculation and the calculations with biasing parameters resultant
from the representative quadrature sets all match within statistical
uncertainty. The \nth{2} detector sees all representative biased flux tallies
matching one another but outside the error bounds of the unbiased flux tally
calculation.

Table \ref{cargo-fwc-fom-table} lists the Figures of Merit for the various
detector locations for the representative quadrature sets. The unbiased
calculation FOM values are also tabulated for reference. We see that the
biasing parameters from the representative LDO quadrature set produce the
highest Figures of Merit for three out of four detector locations, with the
representative QR quadrature set's biasing parameters achieving the highest FOM
for the bottom detector in the array.

To conclude, using LDO quadrature sets to generate Monte Carlo biasing
parameters in the \fwc\ method is particularly promising for cases such as the
simplified portal monitor scenario. When selecting an LDO quadrature set to
generate variance reduction parameters for similar photon transport problems,
a relatively coarse angular mesh of order 5 or 8 may be used to good effect.

%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
\subsection{Summary}

On the whole, little correlation was seen between angular mesh refinement and
the MCNP-reported forward flux tally values in the CADIS context. If using an
LDO quadrature set to generate biasing parameters in this context for any of
the neutron transport scenarios, a low-order (3 - 8) quadrature set may be used
to sufficient effect for flux tally value and FOM achievement. For generating
biasing parameters in the CADIS context for a photon problem with an LDO
quadrature set, the finest available angular mesh should be used. This is
consistent with what is expected based on the difference between neutron and
photon scattering in the materials in these test case scenarios.

In the context of the \fwc\ method, we found that low-order (5 or 8) angular
meshes are sufficient to produce forward flux tally and Figure of Merit values
comparable to those of more refined angular meshes when using LDO quadrature
sets. The superior FOM values resultant from the representative LDO quadrature
set for three of four detectors in the simplified portal monitor scenario
begets interest in further exploration of LDO equations' solutions as input for
Monte Carlo biasing parameters for photon transport in the \fwc\ context.
